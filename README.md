# The Fibonacci Sequence

For anyone unfamiliar, this is where each member of a sequence is the sum of the previous two members. 

_Example: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89._

This small project consists of a tail recursive fibonacci function, and its non-recursive counterpart (using an iteration construct). Written in C.
